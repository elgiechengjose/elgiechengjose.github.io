        <p>One of my favorite things to do is travel.  My wife and I love traveling to new places, especially when it's around Disney trips.  We both grew up as Disney fans, and hope our soon-to-be son become a Disney fan too.  The last trip we took was to <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com">Disneyland</a> and California Adventures with our nieces.  Our favorite area in the park was Star Wars Land.  If you are into Star Wars, it is a recommended place to go!  The Rise of the Resistance attraction was great and worth the effort to get a boarding pass for the ride.

        <p>Growing up as Disney fans, we are going to try to visit every Disney park around the world.  Prior to our Disneyland trip, we visited Tokyo and went to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea.  It was great experience to see the differences between both cultures.  I think the best part of the parks was the foods we ran into.  They had an onigiri sandwich, chinese bun sandwich, mochi filled with custard, and many more Disney themed foods.  They, also, had different flavored popcorn you wouldn't see in the states; like chocolate milk, matcha white chocolate, strawberry, curry and more.
