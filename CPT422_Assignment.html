        <h1> Elgie Jose CPT422 Project </h1>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Elgie Jose.  I am a Dental Assistant, stationed at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea.  I am the Non-commissioned Officer in Charge of Dental Logistics.  I have been in the Air Force for over 8 years.  Most of my years in the Air Force have been overseas.  Before going to Korea, I was stationed at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan for 6 and a half years.  Prior to that, I was stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota for 1 year.  Joining the Air Force has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life, and I don't regret it at all.  Every lesson, good or bad, I have learned from the military has made me the person I am today.  I appreciate every opportunity the military has given to me.</p>
        
        <br><h2>Hobbies</h2>
        
        <p>One of my favorite things to do is travel.  My wife and I love traveling to new places, and we are excited to go to Europe next year.  We both grew up as Disney fans, including our families.  The last trip we took was to Disneyland and California Adventures with our nieces.  Our favorite area in the park was Star Wars Land.  If you are a Star Wars, it is a recommended place to go!  The Rise of the Resistance attraction was great and worth the effort to get a boarding pass for the ride.

        <br>Growing up as Disney fans, we are going to try to visit every Disney park around the world.  Prior to our Disneyland trip, we visited Tokyo and went to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea.  It was great experience to see the differences between both cultures.  I think the best part of the parks was the foods we ran into.  They had an onigiri sandwich, chinese bun sandwich, mochi filled with custard, and many more Disney themed foods.  They, also, had different flavored popcorn you wouldn't see in the states; like chocolate milk, matcha white chocolate, strawberry, curry and more.
