        <p>One of the main hobbies I enjoy doing is playing softball.  Out here in Korea, we have a huge softball community.  We play tournaments every other weekend, consisting of at least 10 teams per tournament.  It's a fun game we all enjoy playing, and we have been playing since we were kids.  It has given me many opportunities to travel around Asia with tournaments in other countries.  I have played in Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Philippines.  My favorite one, so far, has been Philippines because I got to see family while I was out there.  A few of the bat brands that we have been using are <a href="https://monstaathletics.com">Monsta</a> and <a href="https://www.anarchybats.com">Anarchy</a>.  There are different websites you can go through in ordering bats, but I usually go through <a href="https://stores.allamerican-athletics.com">All-American Athletics</a> to check out exclusive bats created.  I have to get my wife's approval first to purchase new bats.  When I do get that chance, that is the website I use to see what I'd like to purchase.  The bats below are a few I have scouted, so far:
