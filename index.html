        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Elgie Jose.  I am a Dental Assistant, stationed at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea.  I am the Non-commissioned Officer in Charge of Dental Logistics.  I have been in the Air Force for over 8 years.  Most of my years in the Air Force have been overseas.  Before going to Korea, I was stationed at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan for 6 and a half years.  Prior to that, I was stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota for 1 year.  Joining the Air Force has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life, and I don't regret it at all.  Every lesson, good or bad, I have learned from the military has made me the person I am today.  I appreciate everything it has given to me.</p>
