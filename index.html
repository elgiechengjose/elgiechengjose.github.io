        <h1> Elgie Jose CPT422 Project </h1>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>

        <p>My name is Elgie Jose.  I am a Dental Assistant, stationed at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea.  I am the Non-commissioned Officer in Charge of Dental Logistics.  I have been in the Air Force for over 8 years.  Most of my years in the Air Force have been overseas.  Before going to Korea, I was stationed at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan for 6 and a half years.  Prior to that, I was stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota for 1 year.  Joining the Air Force has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life, and I don't regret it at all.  Every lesson, good or bad, I have learned from the military has made me the person I am today.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite things to do is travel.  My wife and I love traveling to new places, especially when it's around Disney trips.  We both grew up as Disney fans, and hope our soon-to-be son become a Disney fan too.  The last trip we took was to <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com">Disneyland</a> and California Adventures with our nieces.  Our favorite area in the park was Star Wars Land.  If you are a Star Wars, it is a recommended place to go!  The Rise of the Resistance attraction was great and worth the effort to get a boarding pass for the ride.

        <br>Growing up as Disney fans, we are going to try to visit every Disney park around the world.  Prior to our Disneyland trip, we visited Tokyo and went to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea.  It was great experience to see the differences between both cultures.  I think the best part of the parks was the foods we ran into.  They had an onigiri sandwich, chinese bun sandwich, mochi filled with custard, and many more Disney themed foods.  They, also, had different flavored popcorn you wouldn't see in the states; like chocolate milk, matcha white chocolate, strawberry, curry and more.

	<p>Other than softball, I enjoy bowling.  It was one of those sports that I didn't really enjoy as a kid, but I ended up enjoying it now.  When I got injured from softball, I couldn't really do anything other than sit around on a couch.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  Bowling was my go to when I was bored and didn't have anything to do.  My dad got me into bowling.  He bowled for fun, and he was good at it.  He taught me how to bowl as a kid, but I never enjoyed it because I was bad at the sport.  When I started bowling again in 2015, I started to get better with practice.  I started to enjoy it, and I have been bowling ever since.  I, also, had the chance to bowl in Las Vegas in a <a href="https://www.high-roller.com">Military Bowling Tournament</a>.  It was a great experience and plan on doing it again, in the future.
